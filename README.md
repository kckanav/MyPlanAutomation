# MyPlanAutomation
This application is built to register for classes at the university of washington based on signals from NotifyUW. If a class is full and the student opts for notification 
about class availability through NotifyUW, then this application can automatically register for that class as soon as a notification from NotifyUW comes.

## But why?
I built this application as a lot of my peers where not able to get the classes they wanted because they got full before they could even try to register. Morevoer, the time it 
takes to manually register after getting a notfication from NotifyUW results in the class being full already.

## Added functionality
This application can also automate the process of registration on the student's registration day, so that any delays in manually registering won't lower the chances of 
getting the classes the student wants.
